# TΦT — Type over Tap

**Written here. Verifiable by anyone.**

TΦT is an offline, portable, non-trackable editor built for human writing in the age of AI.

Text is produced exclusively through human typing.
The system records the writing process and generates a verifiable capsule (.tot).

## What is a .tot file

A `.tot` file contains:
- full text
- writing process metadata
- cryptographic hash
- verifiable technical evidence

It can be checked using **TΦT Verify**.

## TΦT Verify

TΦT Verify checks whether a text corresponds to a real human writing process.

It is not AI detection.
It is not stylistic analysis.
It is technical verification.

## Philosophy

TΦT does not claim legal authorship.
It provides technical evidence.

Interpretation remains human.
